<p>Israel was one of the first countries to achieve a high level of full vaccination with the Comirnaty (BNT162b2 mRNA, BioNTech-Pfizer, Mainz, Germany/New York, United States (US)) vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). From May through mid-June 2021, with more than 55% of the population fully vaccinated, new cases decreased to less than two cases per million, with no social restrictions, indicative of very high vaccine effectiveness [<a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2021.26.39.2100822#r1">1</a>,<a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2021.26.39.2100822#r2">2</a>]. Since mid-June, a sharp increase in cases has been observed, attributed to the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak (Pango) lineage designation B.1.617.2 and AY.* sublineages), which by mid-July constituted more than 95% of sequenced virus isolates in Israel [<a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2021.26.39.2100822#r3">3</a>]. This variant was assessed to have higher transmissibility than the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7 and Q.* sublineages) [<a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2021.26.39.2100822#r4">4</a>].</p>
<p>We present an investigation of a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak that started from one unidentified COVID-19 patient, with extensive, rapid nosocomial spread among vaccinated, including individuals wearing surgical masks.</p>
