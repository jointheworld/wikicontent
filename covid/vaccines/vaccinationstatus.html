<p>By November 30, 2021, approximately 130,781 COVID-19–associated deaths, one in six of all U.S. deaths from COVID-19, had occurred in California and New York.* COVID-19 vaccination protects against infection with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), associated severe illness, and death (<i>1</i>,<i>2</i>); among those who survive, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection also confers protection against severe outcomes in the event of reinfection (<i>3</i>,<i>4</i>). The relative magnitude and duration of infection- and vaccine-derived protection, alone and together, can guide public health planning and epidemic forecasting. To examine the impact of primary COVID-19 vaccination and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection on COVID-19 incidence and hospitalization rates, statewide testing, surveillance, and COVID-19 immunization data from California and New York (which account for 18% of the U.S. population) were analyzed. Four cohorts of adults aged ≥18 years were considered: persons who were 1) unvaccinated with no previous laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, 2) vaccinated (14 days after completion of a primary COVID-19 vaccination series) with no previous COVID-19 diagnosis, 3) unvaccinated with a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, and 4) vaccinated with a previous COVID-19 diagnosis. Age-adjusted hazard rates of incident laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in both states were compared among cohorts, and in California, hospitalizations during May 30–November 20, 2021, were also compared. During the study period, COVID-19 incidence in both states was highest among unvaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis compared with that among the other three groups. During the week beginning May 30, 2021, compared with COVID-19 case rates among unvaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, COVID-19 case rates were 19.9-fold (California) and 18.4-fold (New York) lower among vaccinated persons without a previous diagnosis; 7.2-fold (California) and 9.9-fold lower (New York) among unvaccinated persons with a previous COVID-19 diagnosis; and 9.6-fold (California) and 8.5-fold lower (New York) among vaccinated persons with a previous COVID-19 diagnosis. During the same period, compared with hospitalization rates among unvaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization rates in California followed a similar pattern. These relationships changed after the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant became predominant (i.e., accounted for &gt;50% of sequenced isolates) in late June and July. By the week beginning October 3, compared with COVID-19 cases rates among unvaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, case rates among vaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis were 6.2-fold (California) and 4.5-fold (New York) lower; rates were substantially lower among both groups with previous COVID-19 diagnoses, including 29.0-fold (California) and 14.7-fold lower (New York) among unvaccinated persons with a previous diagnosis, and 32.5-fold (California) and 19.8-fold lower (New York) among vaccinated persons with a previous diagnosis of COVID-19. During the same period, compared with hospitalization rates among unvaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization rates in California followed a similar pattern. These results demonstrate that vaccination protects against COVID-19 and related hospitalization, and that surviving a previous infection protects against a reinfection and related hospitalization. Importantly, infection-derived protection was higher after the Delta variant became predominant, a time when vaccine-induced immunity for many persons declined because of immune evasion and immunologic waning (<i>2</i>,<i>5</i>,<i>6</i>). Similar cohort data accounting for booster doses needs to be assessed, as new variants, including Omicron, circulate. Although the epidemiology of COVID-19 might change with the emergence of new variants, vaccination remains the safest strategy to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections and associated complications; all eligible persons should be up to date with COVID-19 vaccination. Additional recommendations for vaccine doses might be warranted in the future as the virus and immunity levels change.</p>
<p>Four cohorts of persons aged ≥18 years were assembled via linkages of records from electronic laboratory reporting databases and state-specific immunization information systems.<sup>†</sup> Persons were classified based on whether they had had a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by March 1, 2021 (i.e., previous COVID-19 diagnosis)<sup>§</sup>; had received at least the primary COVID-19 vaccination series<sup>¶</sup> by May 16, 2021; had a previous COVID-19 diagnosis and were fully vaccinated**; or had neither received a previous COVID-19 diagnosis by March 1 nor received a first COVID-19 vaccine dose by the end of the analysis period. The size of the unvaccinated group without a previous diagnosis was derived by subtracting the observed groups from U.S. Census estimates.<sup>††</sup> To maintain each defined cohort, persons who received a COVID-19 diagnosis during March 1–May 30, 2021, or who died before May 30, 2021, were excluded (to maintain eligibility for incident cases for all cohorts on May 30, 2021),<sup>§§</sup> as were persons who received a first vaccine dose during May 30–November 20, 2021. During May 30–November 20, 2021, incident cases were defined using a positive nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) result from the California COVID-19 Reporting System (CCRS) or a positive NAAT or antigen test result from the New York Electronic Clinical Laboratory Reporting System. In California, person-level hospitalization data from CCRS and supplementary hospitalization reports were used to identify COVID-19–associated hospitalizations. A lifetable method was used to calculate hazard rates (average daily cases during a 7-day interval or hospitalizations over a 14-day interval), hazard ratios, and 95% CIs for each cohort. Rates were age-adjusted to 2000 U.S. Census data using direct standardization.<sup>¶¶</sup> Supplementary analyses stratified case rates by timing of previous diagnoses and primary series vaccine product. SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute) and R (version 4.0.4; The R Foundation) were used to conduct all analyses. Institutional review boards (IRBs) in both states determined this surveillance activity to be necessary for public health work, and therefore, it did not require IRB review.</p>
<p>Approximately three quarters of adults from California (71.2%) and New York (72.2%) included in this analysis were vaccinated and did not have a previous COVID-19 diagnosis; however, 18.0% of California residents and 18.4% of New York residents were unvaccinated with no previous COVID-19 diagnosis (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7104e1.htm#T1_down"><u>Table 1</u></a>). In both states, 4.5% of persons were vaccinated and had a previous COVID-19 diagnosis; 6.3% in California and 4.9% in New York were unvaccinated with a previous diagnosis. Among 1,108,600 incident COVID-19 cases in these cohorts (752,781 in California and 355,819 in New York), the median intervals from vaccination or previous COVID-19 diagnosis to incident diagnosis were slightly shorter in California (138–150 days) than in New York (162–171 days).</p>
<p>Before the Delta variant became predominant in each state’s U.S. Department of Health and Human Services region (June 26 in Region 9 [California] and July 3 in Region 2 [New York]),*** the highest incidence was among unvaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis; during this time, case rates were relatively low among the three groups with either previous infection or vaccination and were lowest among vaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis (Supplementary Figure 1, <a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/113253"><u>https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/113253</u></a>) (Supplementary Figure 2, <a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/113253"><u>https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/113253</u></a>). During the week beginning May 30, 2021, compared with COVID-19 case rates among unvaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, COVID-19 case rates were 19.9-fold (California) and 18.4-fold (New York) lower among vaccinated persons without a previous diagnosis; rates were 7.2-fold (California) and 9.9-fold (New York) lower among unvaccinated persons with a previous COVID-19 diagnosis and 9.6-fold (California) and 8.5-fold (New York) lower among vaccinated persons with a previous COVID-19 diagnosis (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7104e1.htm#T2_down"><u>Table 2</u></a>).</p>
<p>As the Delta variant prevalence increased to &gt;95% (97% in Region 9 and 98% in Region 2 on August 1), rates increased more rapidly among the vaccinated group with no previous COVID-19 diagnosis than among both the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups with a previous COVID-19 diagnosis (Supplementary Figure 1, <a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/113253"><u>https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/113253</u></a>) (Supplementary Figure 2, <a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/113253"><u>https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/113253</u></a>). For example, during the week of October 3, compared with rates among unvaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, rates among vaccinated persons without a previous diagnosis were 6.2-fold lower (95% CI&nbsp;=&nbsp;6.0–6.4) in California and 4.5-fold lower (95% CI&nbsp;=&nbsp;4.3–4.7) in New York (Table 2). Further, rates among unvaccinated persons with a previous COVID-19 diagnosis were 29-fold lower (95% CI&nbsp;=&nbsp;25.0–33.1) than rates among unvaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis in California and 14.7-fold lower (95% CI&nbsp;=&nbsp;12.6–16.9) in New York. Rates among vaccinated persons who had had COVID-19 were 32.5-fold lower (95% CI&nbsp;=&nbsp;27.5–37.6) than rates among unvaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis in California and 19.8-fold lower (95% CI&nbsp;=&nbsp;16.2–23.5) in New York. Rates among vaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis were consistently higher than rates among unvaccinated persons with a history of COVID-19 (3.1-fold higher [95% CI&nbsp;=&nbsp;2.6–3.7] in California and 1.9-fold higher [95% CI&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.5–2.3] in New York) and rates among vaccinated persons with a history of COVID-19 (3.6-fold higher [95% CI&nbsp;=&nbsp;2.9–4.3] in California and 2.8-fold higher [95% CI&nbsp;=&nbsp;2.1–3.4] in New York).</p>
<p>COVID-19 hospitalization rates in California were always highest among unvaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis (Table 2) (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7104e1.htm#F1_down"><u>Figure</u></a>). In the pre-Delta period during June 13–June 26, for example, compared with hospitalization rates among unvaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization rates were 27.7-fold lower (95% CI = 22.4–33.0) among vaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, 6.0-fold lower (95% CI = 3.3–8.7) among unvaccinated persons with a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, and 7.1-fold lower (95% CI = 4.0–10.3) among vaccinated persons with a previous COVID-19 diagnosis. However, this pattern also shifted as the Delta variant became predominant. During October 3–16, compared with hospitalization rates among unvaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization rates were 19.8-fold lower (95% CI = 18.2–21.4) among vaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, 55.3-fold lower (95% CI = 27.3–83.3) among unvaccinated persons with a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, and 57.5-fold lower (95% CI = 29.2–85.8) among vaccinated persons with a previous COVID-19 diagnosis.</p>
<p>Among the two cohorts with a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, no consistent incidence gradient by time since the previous diagnosis was observed (Supplementary Figure 3, <a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/113253"><u>https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/113253</u></a>). When the vaccinated cohorts were stratified by the vaccine product received, among vaccinated persons without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis, the highest incidences were observed among persons receiving the Janssen (Johnson &amp; Johnson), followed by Pfizer-BioNTech, then Moderna vaccines (Supplementary Figure 4, <a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/113253"><u>https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/113253</u></a>). No pattern by product was observed among vaccinated persons with a previous COVID-19 diagnosis.</p>
