<h2>Concerns raised</h2>
<p>In her 25 September email to the FDA Jackson wrote that Ventavia had enrolled more than 1000 participants at three sites. The full trial (registered under <a href="https://www.bmj.com/lookup/external-ref?link_type=CLINTRIALGOV&amp;access_num=NCT04368728&amp;atom=%2Fbmj%2F375%2Fbmj.n2635.atom">NCT04368728</a>) enrolled around 44 000 participants across 153 sites that included numerous commercial companies and academic centres. She then listed a dozen concerns she had witnessed, including:</p>
<p>Participants placed in a hallway after injection and not being monitored by clinical staff</p>
<p>Lack of timely follow-up of patients who experienced adverse events</p>
<p>Protocol deviations not being reported</p>
<p>Vaccines not being stored at proper temperatures</p>
<p>Mislabelled laboratory specimens, and</p>
<p>Targeting of Ventavia staff for reporting these types of problems.</p>
<p>Within hours Jackson received an email from the FDA thanking her for her concerns and notifying her that the FDA could not comment on any investigation that might result. A few days later Jackson received a call from an FDA inspector to discuss her report but was told that no further information could be provided. She heard nothing further in relation to her report.</p>
<p>In Pfizer’s briefing document submitted to an FDA advisory committee meeting held on 10 December 2020 to discuss Pfizer’s application for emergency use authorisation of its covid-19 vaccine, the company made no mention of problems at the Ventavia site. The next day the FDA issued the authorisation of the vaccine.<a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/375/bmj.n2635#ref-8"><strong>8</strong></a></p>
<p>In August this year, after the full approval of Pfizer’s vaccine, the FDA published a summary of its inspections of the company’s pivotal trial. Nine of the trial’s 153 sites were inspected. Ventavia’s sites were not listed among the nine, and no inspections of sites where adults were recruited took place in the eight months after the December 2020 emergency authorisation. The FDA’s inspection officer noted: “The data integrity and verification portion of the BIMO [bioresearch monitoring] inspections were limited because the study was ongoing, and the data required for verification and comparison were not yet available to the IND [investigational new drug].”</p>
