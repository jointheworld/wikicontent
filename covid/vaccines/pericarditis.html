<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 infection have been effective in reducing the number of symptomatic cases worldwide. With widespread uptake, case series of vaccine-related myocarditis/pericarditis have been reported, particularly in adolescents and young adults. Men tend to be affected with greater frequency, and symptom onset is usually within 1 week after vaccination. Clinical course appears to be mild in most cases. On the basis of the available evidence, we highlight a clinical framework to guide providers on how to assess, investigate, diagnose, and report suspected and confirmed cases. In any patient with highly suggestive symptoms temporally related to COVID-19 mRNA vaccination, standardized workup includes serum troponin measurement and polymerase chain reaction testing for COVID-19 infection, routine additional lab work, and a 12-lead electrocardiogram. Echocardiography is recommended as the imaging modality of choice for patients with unexplained troponin elevation and/or pathologic electrocardiogram changes. Cardiovascular specialist consultation and hospitalization should be considered on the basis of the results of standard investigations. Treatment is largely supportive, and myocarditis/pericarditis that is diagnosed according to defined clinical criteria should be reported to public health authorities in every jurisdiction. Finally, we recommend COVID-19 vaccination in all individuals in accordance with the Health Canada and National Advisory Committee on Immunization guidelines. In patients with suspected myocarditis/pericarditis after the first dose of an mRNA vaccine, deferral of a second dose is recommended until additional reports become available.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 have shown unprecedented efficacy with respect to prevention of symptomatic infection and severe illness. With the development of COVID-19 variants of concern including variant B.1.617.2 for which 2 vaccinations are needed to confer immunity, continued public health initiatives promoting vaccine use has continued. Recently, an association with myocarditis and pericarditis has been reported to be related to mRNA vaccination.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8349442/#bib0001">1</a> Historically, myocarditis/pericarditis has been reported after a smallpox live vaccine, with an incidence of 2.16-7.8 per 100,000 vaccines with reports occurring up to 30 days post vaccination. Most of these patients recover without any long-term sequelae. Other live viral vaccines (including measles-mumps-rubella, varicella, oral polio, or yellow fever vaccine) have a lower incidence of myocarditis/pericarditis (0.24 per 100,000 vaccines). The likelihood of an association between COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and myocarditis/pericarditis has understandably generated significant interest among health care providers, the scientific community, and the public. This issue is particularly germane during this phase of the pandemic with public health efforts increasingly focused on vaccination of adolescents and young adults, and because further expansion of vaccine efforts in children younger than 12 years of age is anticipated in the coming months.</p>
<p>The aim of this commentary is to provide a real-time pragmatic framework for cardiovascular care providers in Canada to address concerns of myocarditis/pericarditis potentially related to mRNA vaccination. The author group includes expertise in adult and pediatric cardiology, primary care, emergency medicine, policy, public health and vaccinology. Herein, we summarize the current state of knowledge regarding incidence and preliminary outcomes of mRNA vaccine-related myocarditis/pericarditis, address the evaluation, management, and reporting of suspected cases, and provide a suggested approach to informed decision-making with patients who receive the COVID-19 mRNA vaccination.</p>
<p>We recognize that this is a rapidly evolving area of great interest to multiple stakeholders, especially young patients and their families, and our understanding of the link between myocarditis/pericarditis and mRNA vaccines will likely be informed by new and emerging data. This commentary has been endorsed by the Canadian Cardiovascular Society's COVID-19 Rapid Response Team and by the Canadian Pediatric Cardiology Association.</p>
