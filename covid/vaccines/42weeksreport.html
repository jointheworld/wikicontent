<p>The rate of a positive COVID-19 test varies by age and vaccination status. The rate of a positive COVID-19 test is substantially lower in vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals up to the age of 29. In individuals aged greater than 30, the rate of a positive COVID-19 test is higher in vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated. This is likely to be due to a variety of reasons, including differences in the population of vaccinated and unvaccinated people as well as differences in testing patterns. The rate of hospitalisation within 28 days of a positive COVID-19 test increases with age, and is substantially greater in unvaccinated individuals compared to vaccinated individuals. The rate of death within 28 days or within 60 days of a positive COVID-19 test increases with age, and again is substantially greater in unvaccinated individuals compared to fully vaccinated individuals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Table 6: Roche N seropositivity (95%CI) estimates by age group Age group Weeks 21-32 Weeks 33-40 17-29 24.1% (22.6% - 25.8%) 28.8% (26.6% - 31.0%) 30-39 18.4% (17.3% - 19.7%) 23.6% (22.0% - 25.3%) 40-49 17.6% (16.5% - 18.8%) 19.9% (18.5% - 21.5%) 50-59 16.4% (15.4% - 17.4%) 18.4% (17.1% - 19.7%) 60-69 11.0% (10.0% - 12.0%) 13.4% (12.2% - 14.8%) 70-84 7.2% (6.0% - 8.7%) 7.9% (6.4% - 9.7%) Small increases in Roche N seropositivity have recently been observed across all age groups (Table 6) compared to the previous 12-week period. Increases in the overall COVID-19 case rates in England have been observed across all age groups and regions in week 40 (Weekly national Influenza and COVID-19 surveillance report week 41). Roche S seropositivity in blood donors has plateaued and is now over 96% across all age groups. Seropositivity estimates for S antibody in blood donors are likely to be higher than would be expected in the general population and this probably reflects the fact that donors are more likely to be vaccinated. Seropositivity estimates for N antibody will underestimate the proportion of the population previously infected due to (i) blood donors are potentially less likely to be exposed to natural infection than age matched individuals in the general population (ii) waning of the N antibody response over time and (iii) recent observations from UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) surveillance data that N antibody levels appear to be lower in individuals who acquire infection following 2 doses of vaccination. Vaccination has made an important contribution to the overall Roche S increases observed since the roll out of the vaccination programme, initially amongst individuals aged 50 years and above who were prioritised for vaccination as part of the phase 1 programme and more recently in younger adults as part of phase 2 of the vaccination programme. Roche S levels by age group and month The Roche S assay that the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) uses for serological surveillance is fully quantitative, meaning that it measures the level of antibodies in a blood sample; an antibody level above 0.8 AU/ml (approximately one IU/ml using the WHO standard) is deemed positive. The PHE and UKHSA surveillance over the past few months has found that over 97% of the population of blood donors test positive for S-antibodies, which may have resulted from either COVID-19 infection or vaccination. With such high seropositivity, it is important to look at population antibody levels in order to assess the impact of the vaccination booster programme. COVID-19 vaccine surveillance report â€“ week 42 24 Figure 6 shows monthly categorised Roche S levels in N-antibody negative individuals by age group. Almost all tested S-antibody negative during December. In the 3 oldest age groups, the impact of first vaccine dose, then second vaccine dose, can be seen from December through June, as the profile of population antibody levels increases. Then from June through September the profile of antibody levels in these cohorts gradually decreases, consistent with waning. During October there is a small increase in percentage of donors with high antibody levels of 1000+ AU/ml for the 70 to 84 age group only, following the initiation of the booster programme. The higher profile of antibody levels in the youngest age group, is likely a result of a combination of factors including stronger immune responses in younger individuals and the higher antibody levels produced after mRNA vaccination. Figure 7 shows categorised Roche S levels in N-antibody positive individuals, those likely to have experienced past infection. Pre-vaccination antibody levels will be influenced by time since infection, variant and severity of infection, as well as personal factors such as underlying health conditions and age. At the start of the vaccination rollout in December antibody levels typically sat within the range of 0.8 to 1000 AU/ml, after vaccination antibody levels typically exceed 1000 AU/ml. Comparing Figure 6 with Figure 7, the overall higher profile of antibody levels in those who have experienced past infection is evident; both vaccination post infection and breakthrough infection following vaccination are expected to boost existing antibody levels. Researchers across the globe are working to better understand what antibody levels mean in terms of protection against COVID-19. Current thinking is that there is no threshold antibody level that offers complete protection against infection, but instead that higher antibody levels are likely to be associated with lower probability of infection.</p>
