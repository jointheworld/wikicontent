<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/covid-19">Coronavirus disease 2019</a> (COVID-19) began in December 2019 and has affected millions of people all over the world. Respiratory illness in the form of severe pneumonia, in addition to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/multiple-organ-dysfunction-syndrome">multiorgan failure</a> and death, is the clinical spectrum of COVID-19. Although there are no specific therapeutic agents for COVID-19 infection, the COVID-19 vaccine reduces morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19 infection and is generally well tolerated. We report one potential complication of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine: a known case of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) that occurred after the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine alone without exposure to any other drug. Despite the initial severe adverse reaction, the patient showed a full recovery. Although SJS can be associated with COVID-19 vaccination, it is rare, and the benefits of receiving the vaccination outweigh the potential harms.</p>
