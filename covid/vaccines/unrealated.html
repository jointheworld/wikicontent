<p>Vaccines currently are the primary mitigation strategy to combat COVID-19 around the world. For instance, the narrative related to the ongoing surge of new cases in the United States (US) is argued to be driven by areas with low vaccination rates [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10654-021-00808-7#ref-CR1">1</a>]. A&nbsp;similar narrative also has been observed in countries, such as Germany and the United Kingdom [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10654-021-00808-7#ref-CR2">2</a>]. At the same time, Israel that was hailed for its swift and high rates of vaccination has also seen a substantial resurgence in COVID-19 cases [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10654-021-00808-7#ref-CR3">3</a>]. We investigate the relationship between the percentage of population&nbsp; fully vaccinated and new COVID-19 cases across 68 countries and across 2947 counties in&nbsp;the US.</p>
