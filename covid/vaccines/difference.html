<h2><strong>Abstract</strong></h2>
<p>We found no significant difference in cycle threshold values between vaccinated and unvaccinated, asymptomatic and symptomatic groups infected with SARS-CoV-2 Delta. Given the substantial proportion of asymptomatic vaccine breakthrough cases with high viral levels, interventions, including masking and testing, should be considered for all in settings with elevated COVID-19 transmission.</p>
<h2><strong>Background</strong></h2>
<p>Vaccines reduce infection, severe disease, and death from SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) [<a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.28.21264262v2.full-text#ref-1"><strong>1</strong></a>], yet breakthrough cases occur [<a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.28.21264262v2.full-text#ref-2"><strong>2</strong></a>]. Several reports show no difference in cycle threshold values (Ct-values) between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals [<a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.28.21264262v2.full-text#ref-2"><strong>2</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.28.21264262v2.full-text#ref-3"><strong>3</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.28.21264262v2.full-text#ref-4"><strong>4</strong></a>]; however, others have suggested that breakthrough infections, particularly among asymptomatic individuals, have a lower viral load and therefore may be less likely to result in transmission [<a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.28.21264262v2.full-text#ref-5"><strong>5</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.28.21264262v2.full-text#ref-6"><strong>6</strong></a>].</p>
<p>Effective epidemic control requires contemporary data to guide public health mitigation measures. Here, we report on Ct-values among fully vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, asymptomatic and symptomatic at time of testing, during a period of high transmission of the Delta variant in two distinct populations: a Unidos en Salud (UeS) community-based site in the Mission District of San Francisco and Healthy Yolo Together (HYT) asymptomatic testing through the University of California (UC), Davis.</p>
