<h1><strong>Risk of False Results with the Curative SARS-Cov-2 Test for COVID-19: FDA Safety Communication</strong></h1>
<p>The Curative, Inc., Curative SARS-Cov-2 Assay (originally authorized as the Korvalabs, Inc. Curative-Korva SARS-Cov-2 Assay) Emergency Use Authorization was revoked at the companyâ€™s request effective July 15, 2021, because the company is now using different EUA-authorized tests for the testing offered at its laboratories. The test that is the subject of this safety communication is no longer being offered and is no longer authorized for emergency use by the FDA.</p>

<p><strong>Date Issued:</strong> January 4, 2021</p>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is alerting patients and health care providers of the risk of false results, particularly false negative results, with the Curative SARS-Cov-2 test. Risks to a patient of a false negative result include: delayed or lack of supportive treatment, lack of monitoring of infected individuals and their household or other close contacts for symptoms resulting in increased risk of spread of COVID-19 within the community, or other unintended adverse events.</p>
<p>To reduce the risk of false negative results, it is important to perform the test in accordance with its authorization and as described in the authorized labeling, e.g., the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/137087/download"><u>Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers</u></a>. When the test is not performed in accordance with its authorization or as described in the authorized labeling, there is a greater risk that the results of the test may not be accurate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
