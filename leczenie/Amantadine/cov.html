<p>Shortly after the onset of the pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), concerns were raised about the potentially heightened risks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with Parkinson disease (PD).<a href="https://accp1.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcph.1802#jcph1802-bib-0001"><sup>1</sup></a> To substantiate these suspicions, we performed a questionnaire-based study to assess the severity of COVID-19 in patients suffering PD and multiple sclerosis (MS), whose SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of nasopharyngeal swabs. We found that none of them (PD, n&nbsp;= 5; MS, n&nbsp;= 10) developed severe clinical manifestations of infectious disease. Importantly, all patients were taking amantadine.<a href="https://accp1.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcph.1802#jcph1802-bib-0002"><sup>2</sup></a> Although the aforementioned lack of severe cases among patients taking amantadine could happen by chance, it also provoked hypothesis generation. We suggested that our finding may reflect possible effect of amantadine antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, it has recently been shown that amantadine interferes with the lysosomal milieu and may inhibit the virus's entry to host cells.<a href="https://accp1.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcph.1802#jcph1802-bib-0003"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
