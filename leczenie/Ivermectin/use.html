<h2>Proper Use</h2>
<p>Drug information provided by: <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/end-user-acknowledgement"><u>IBM Micromedex</u></a></p>
<p>Ivermectin is best taken as a single dose with a full glass (8 ounces) of water on an empty stomach (1 hour before breakfast), unless otherwise directed by your doctor.</p>
<p>To help clear up your infection, take this medicine exactly as directed. Your doctor may want you to take another dose every 3 to 12 months.</p>
<p>Your doctor may also prescribe a corticosteroid (a cortisone-like medicine) for certain patients with river blindness, especially those with severe symptoms. This is to help reduce the inflammation caused by the death of the worms. If your doctor prescribes these two medicines together, it is important to take the corticosteroid along with ivermectin. Take them exactly as directed by your doctor. Do not miss any doses.</p>
